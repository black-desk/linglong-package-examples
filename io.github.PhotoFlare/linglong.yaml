    This is an effort to bring quick, simple but powerful image editing to the masses. PhotoFlare is inspired by the image editor currently only available on Microsoft Windows ¨C PhotoFiltre. However, it will not be a straight clone. It is being built from the ground up to be much improved and cross platform too!
